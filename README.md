## MyToken_2469

MyToken is an ERC20-compliant token created using Solidity on a local Hardhat network. The contract allows the contract owner to mint tokens to a provided address, while any user can burn and transfer tokens.

## Prerequisites
To deploy and interact with the contract, you'll need the following:

1. Remix IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Hardhat (https://hardhat.org/)
3. Solidity compiler

## Description
The contract allows the contract owner to mint tokens to a provided address, while any user can burn and transfer tokens.


## Interacting with the Contract in Remix
1.Open Remix IDE in your browser: https://remix.ethereum.org/

2.In the Remix file explorer, create a new file called MyToken.sol and copy the contents of the contracts/MyToken.sol file into it.

3.Compile the contract by selecting the appropriate compiler version in Remix and clicking on the "Compile" button.

4.Once the contract is successfully compiled, go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in Remix.

5.Select the "Injected Web3" environment from the dropdown menu to connect to your local Hardhat network.

6.Click on the "Deploy" button to deploy the contract.

7.After the contract is deployed, you should see the deployed contract instance in the "Deployed Contracts" section.

8.In the deployed contract instance, you'll find the available functions like mint, burn, and transfer. You can interact with these functions by providing the required parameters and clicking on the respective function buttons.

9.To mint tokens, make sure to connect Remix with the address of the contract owner.

10.Remember to connect to the correct network in Remix and ensure that you have the required tokens in your account to perform token transfers or burns.
